To play this game you need to have ruby installed in your system.
Then you can simply run: ruby game.rb

You'll then be prompted to select your game mode: PvP, PvE, EvE (if you just want to watch)

Unless you've chosen PvP, you'll be required to select the game level:
1 - Easy (computer plays in the first spot available)
2 - Medium (computer plays at random spot)
3 - Hard (computer will play the best spot) -- You can't win

Have fun
